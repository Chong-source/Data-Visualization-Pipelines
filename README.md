# Data-Visualization-Bioinformatics
This is a data visualization project that I am working on during my workstudy during the summer of 2024. I keep all the work that I did for the lab in this private repository. 

# Project 1: Ball and Stick Graph
This program takes in the raw CSV file of dN/dS value and converts it to a ball and stick graph. For further instructions, please refer to the pdf attached to the ball and stick graph folder

## Project 1: Ball and Stick Graph
This program takes in the raw CSV file of dN/dS value and converts it to a ball and stick graph. For further instructions, please refer to the pdf attached to the ball and stick graph folder.

## Project 2: Flow Cytometry graph
This pipe line cleans the data from the flow cytometry analysis, and automatically generates bar plots with error bars. Additionally, these bar plots are exported automatically to a pptx presentation, where the user can change the titles of the genes as they like. I built a mini-interface for the user to directly type in the file's name instead of going into the R file and changing the file name there. This application only requires the installation of python, instead of R-Studio. 

## Project 3: Phylo Tree pptx
In this project. I convert the Phylo genetic tree data into phylo tree plots, and again, I convert them into pptx format, where you can edit the names on the phylo tree as you like.

## Project 4: Retinal Release
In this project, I automated publication ready figures for retinal release data collected from light experiments.
